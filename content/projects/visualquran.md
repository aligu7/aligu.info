# Internship

I am working on this project as part of my internship at **<a target="new" href="https://optimaxsoftware.com"><u>Optimax Software</u></a>**.

# About the Project

Visual Quran leverages modern charting and graph libraries to bring the intricate structure and historical layers of the Quran to life.

This is also a data visualisation experiment. By using interactive charts, maps, and graphs, we aim to provide a deeper understanding of the Quran's content, context, and significance.

## Our visualizations include:

- **Juz & Surah Analysis**: Explore dynamic charts that break down the Quran into its 30 Juz and 114 Surahs, revealing patterns in word count, themes, and more.
- **Prophet Narratives**: Follow interactive timelines and network graphs that map the stories of the Prophets mentioned in the Quran, showing their relationships and key events.
- **Event Mapping**: Discover significant Quranic events and locations through geo-tagged visualizations that contextualize historical narratives.
- **Data-Driven Insights**: Use filters, tooltips, and interactive dashboards to dive deep into the numerical and thematic data embedded in the Quranic text.

# Our Vision

We aim to empower both scholars and curious explorers by presenting the Quran in a new light—where data meets divine wisdom. By merging traditional scholarship with modern technology, Visual Quran offers fresh insights and a visually compelling way to study one of the world's most influential texts.

Join us in this journey to experience the Quran beyond words—through the power of visual storytelling.
