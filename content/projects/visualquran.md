# About the Project

Visual Quran leverages modern charting and graph libraries to bring the intricate structure and historical layers of the Quran to life. The repo will probably become public in  <a target="new" href="https://github.com/quran-center"><u>(github.com/quran-center)</u></a>, but not sure yet. Our visualizations include:

- Juz & Surah Analysis: Explore dynamic charts that break down the Quran into its 30 Juz and 114 Surahs, revealing patterns in word count, themes, and more.
- Prophet Narratives: Follow interactive timelines and network graphs that map the stories of the Prophets mentioned in the Quran, showing their relationships and key events.
- Event Mapping: Discover significant Quranic events and locations through geo-tagged visualizations that contextualize historical narratives.
- Data-Driven Insights: Use filters, tooltips, and interactive dashboards to dive deep into the numerical and thematic data embedded in the Quranic text.

# Our Vision

We aim to empower both scholars and curious explorers by presenting the Quran in a new light—where data meets divine wisdom. By merging traditional scholarship with modern technology, Visual Quran offers fresh insights and a visually compelling way to study one of the world's most influential texts.

Join us in this journey to experience the Quran beyond words—through the power of visual storytelling.

# Release

Once the project is released, this post will be updated with exact changes and features available in the project. Also the link to the project will be available here. Keep in mind that the features listed above are still under construction, so they are approximated.
